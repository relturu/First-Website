                    <p>
                        I'm from a small city in the South part of the Bay Area.
                        I grew up with a younger brother (Andres) and my parents, Erin and Sebastian.
                        For high school, I attended Homestead High, and later got 
                        aceepted into Carnegie Mellon University. In my free time, I like to play 
                        sports like soccer and volleyball, as well as explore by hiking, climbing,
                        or snowboarding!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Section on Impact</h2>
                    <p>
                        Growing up there impacted me in several ways, most notably the influence
                        and emphasis on technology. Both my parents studied, and worked in the field of 
                        Electrical Engineering - so as you can imagine I figured I should also do something
                        along the same pathway. Additionally, my high school was rather STEM heavy, so
                        I found myself surrounded by a driven and hardworking community often involved with tech.
